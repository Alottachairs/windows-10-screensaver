## To install:

Download and install latest version of python (3.10)

clone the repo or download the zip file and extract.

Use the command prompt or terminal and change directory to the location of **main.py**

run the commands:

`pip install ursina`

if you do not have pip installed, install that first.

then run:

`python main.py`
or
`python3 main.py`

I made this for fun because I always liked the windows 98 version :)
